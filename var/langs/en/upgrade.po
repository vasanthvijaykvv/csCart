To prepare for June 2024, add a new shipping method that uses the new \"UPS\" for rate calculation. Once you acquire the credentials and make sure that the new shipping method works, you can disable the deprecated shipping methods.</br></br><a class=\"btn btn-primary\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"[url]\">Go to shipping methods</a>"
